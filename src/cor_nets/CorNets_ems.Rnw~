\section{Summary}
Community analyses have typically left species inter-corrlation
  information un-untilized. Here we present software to:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Conduct ecoinformatics with large community datasets
\item Model community networks of species relationships using
  species inter-correlations present in community datasets
\item Calculate distances between network models for distance-based analyses
\end{enumerate}

\section{Introdution}
\begin{itemize}
\item Information about relationships among species (either through
  direct interactions or responses to evironmental variation) is
  valuable for inferring the dynamics of communities.
\item Quantitative modeling of species interactions can be traced back
  to the assembly rules paper of Diamond (1975) which proposed that
  the outcome of competitive exclusion could be inferred
  quantitatively.
\item Currently, quantitative ecologists are advancing methods to
  infer species relationships at even finer scales of resoltion in the
  context of complex communities.
\item Here, we present software written in the R programming language
  that provides tools to conduct quantitative modeling of
  inter-species relationships based on species correlations.
\item In addition, we present a set of functions to analyze the
  effects of ecological factors on the structure of community networks. 
\end{itemize}
